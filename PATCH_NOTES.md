# Provider Manager Fix - Patch Notes

## Issue Summary
The `codex-flow swarm spawn` command was failing with the error:
```
❌ Failed to spawn swarm: this.providerManager.getEnabledProviders is not a function
```

## Root Cause
The `AgentFactory` constructor expects a `ProviderManager` instance, but the `SwarmManager` was receiving and passing the raw configuration object instead of a properly instantiated `ProviderManager`.

### Code Flow Issue:
1. `swarm.ts` line 44: `new SwarmManager(configManager.getConfig())`
2. `SwarmManager.ts` line 63: `new AgentFactory(config.providerManager || config.providers)`
3. `AgentFactory.ts` line 26: `constructor(providerManager: ProviderManager)`

The raw config object has a `providers` property (object), not a `providerManager` property (ProviderManager instance).

## Fix Applied

### Files Modified:
1. **src/cli/commands/swarm.ts**
   - Added import for `ProviderManager`
   - Create a proper `ProviderManager` instance from config
   - Pass the instance to `SwarmManager` constructor

2. **src/core/swarm/SwarmManager.ts**
   - Added import for `ProviderManager`
   - Added runtime check to ensure `providerManager` is a proper instance
   - Fallback creation if raw config is passed

### Patch Implementation:
The fix ensures backward compatibility by:
- Checking if `config.providerManager` is already a `ProviderManager` instance
- Creating a new `ProviderManager` instance if needed
- Using sensible defaults for provider configuration

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Failed to spawn swarm: this.providerManager.getEnabledProviders is not a function
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Swarm spawned successfully!
Swarm ID: swarm-1757105751468-1wrr0i651
Active Agents: 5
```

## Next Steps
The primary provider wiring issue is resolved. Remaining issues are:
1. Local provider API compatibility (requires running LLM server)
2. OpenAI provider credential configuration (requires API key)
3. MCP setup script 404 (expected, ruv-swarm-mcp doesn't exist yet)

## Installation Steps
To apply this patch manually:
1. Apply changes from `patches/provider_manager_fix.patch`
2. Rebuild the project: `npm run build`
3. Configure providers: `codex-flow config set providers.local.enabled true`
4. Test: `codex-flow swarm spawn "Build a hello world app" --providers local`
