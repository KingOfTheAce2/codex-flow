# Codex-Flow

Codex-Flow aims to bring the workflows of [Gemini-Flow] and [Claude-Flow] to the OpenAI Codex ecosystem. The project will offer a multi-agent CLI toolkit with pluggable tools and persistent memory so developers can orchestrate Codex-powered tasks and projects.

## Project Status
This repository is currently in the planning stage. Implementation will proceed according to the [project plan](PROJECT_PLAN.md).

## Planned Features
- Swarm and hive mind orchestration for coordinating multiple Codex agents
- Command line interface for initialisation and task execution
- Plugin-based MCP tool system for file, git and service integrations
- SQLite-backed memory store for stateful sessions

## Getting Started
Development has not begun yet. When the foundation is in place, the typical workflow will be:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please discuss major changes in an issue before submitting a PR.
