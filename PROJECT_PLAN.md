## Implementation Insights & Decisions

### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **TypeScript-First**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
2. **Provider Abstraction**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom providers
3. **SQLite Memory**: Local, embedded database for simplicity
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible tool and agent system
