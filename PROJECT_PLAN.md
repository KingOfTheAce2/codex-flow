# Codex-Flow Project Plan

## Objective
Build **Codex-Flow**, an open-source toolkit that mirrors the developer experience of Gemini-Flow and Claude-Flow while targeting OpenAI Codex. The project aims to provide a consistent multi-agent workflow, CLI utilities, and pluggable architecture for Codex-based development.

## Phases

### 1. Foundation
- [ ] Initialise repository with TypeScript + Node.js scaffold
- [ ] Set up package management and scripts (build, lint, test)
- [ ] Establish continuous integration configuration

### 2. Core CLI
- [ ] Port common CLI patterns from Gemini-Flow and Claude-Flow
- [ ] Implement commands for project initialisation and task execution
- [ ] Provide configuration loading with sane defaults for Codex

### 3. Agent Framework
- [ ] Define agent interface compatible with Codex APIs
- [ ] Implement swarm/hive orchestration inspired by existing flows
- [ ] Persist state in lightweight database (SQLite)

### 4. Tooling & Extensions
- [ ] Add MCP tool support for file ops, git, and external services
- [ ] Expose plugin system so developers can add custom tools
- [ ] Include example tools and tests

### 5. Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Write comprehensive README and usage guides
- [ ] Provide sample projects and walkthroughs
- [ ] Document contribution guidelines

### 6. Release & Feedback
- [ ] Publish alpha package to npm
- [ ] Collect community feedback and iterate

## Milestones
| Milestone | Target Date | Deliverables |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| v0.1.0 Foundation | Week 1 | Repo scaffold, CI, basic README |
| v0.2.0 CLI | Week 3 | CLI commands and config system |
| v0.3.0 Agents | Week 5 | Swarm/hive orchestration with memory |
| v0.4.0 Tools | Week 7 | Plugin system and example tools |
| v1.0.0 Alpha | Week 9 | Docs, samples, first release |

## Risks & Mitigations
- **API differences**: Codex behaviour may differ from Gemini/Claude -> abstract provider layer to adapt quickly.
- **Performance**: complex orchestration can introduce latency -> include benchmarking utilities early.
- **Community adoption**: ensure clear docs and contribution guides.
